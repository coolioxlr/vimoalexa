Fitness Motivation Quote is an Alexa App produced by Vimo Labs Inc. At Vimo Labs Inc., we have a few fundamental principles:</i></b></span></h4>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li3"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. (We can’t stand services that ask you for things like your gender or income level for no apparent reason.)</span></li>
  <li class="li3"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.</span></li>
  <li class="li3"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.</span></li>
  <li class="li3"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">In our products, we aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what’s visible to the public, seen by search engines, kept private, and permanently deleted.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Below is our privacy policy which incorporates these goals:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">If you have questions about deleting or correcting your personal data please contact our <a href="mailto:support@jamoapp.com"><span class="s3">support team.</span></a></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">It is Vimo’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our website.</span></p>
<h3 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 14.0px 0.0px; line-height: 17.0px; font: 14.0px Times; color: #000000; -webkit-text-stroke: #000000"><span class="s1"><b>Website Visitors</b></span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Like most website operators, Vimo collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Vimo’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Vimo’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Vimo may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Vimo also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users. Vimo only discloses logged in user IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.</span></p>
<h3 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 14.0px 0.0px; line-height: 17.0px; font: 14.0px Times; color: #000000; -webkit-text-stroke: #000000"><span class="s1"><b>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</b></span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Certain visitors to Vimo’s websites choose to interact with Vimo in ways that require Vimo to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Vimo gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up to provide an email address. Those who engage in transactions with Vimo are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, Vimo collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Vimo. Vimo does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</span></p>
<h3 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 14.0px 0.0px; line-height: 17.0px; font: 14.0px Times; color: #000000; -webkit-text-stroke: #000000"><span class="s1"><b>Aggregated Statistics</b></span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Vimo may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. Vimo may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Vimo does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</span></p>
<h3 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 14.0px 0.0px; line-height: 17.0px; font: 14.0px Times; color: #000000; -webkit-text-stroke: #000000"><span class="s1"><b>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</b></span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Vimo discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Vimo’s behalf or to provide services available at Vimo’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Vimo’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Vimo will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Vimo discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Vimo believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Vimo, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an Vimo website and have supplied your email address, Vimo may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Vimo and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Vimo takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s1">A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Vimo uses cookies to help Vimo identify and track visitors, their usage of Vimo website, and their website access preferences. Vimo visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Vimo’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of Vimo’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s1">If Vimo, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Vimo goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Vimo may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.</span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Ads appearing on any of our websites may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Vimo and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Although most changes are likely to be minor, Vimo may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Vimo’s sole discretion. Vimo encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</span></p>
